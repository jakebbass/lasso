## Design Guidelines

- **Keep it clean**: Avoid cluttered screenshots with too much information
- **Use real content**: Populate the app with realistic product data and user information
- **Highlight key features**: Use captions or annotations to draw attention to important features
- **Maintain consistency**: Use the same style, device frame, and background across all screenshots
- **Consider localization**: If submitting to multiple regions, prepare localized versions of screenshots

## Screenshot Preparation Checklist

- [ ] Ensure app is fully styled with final design elements
- [ ] Use demo/test accounts with realistic data
- [ ] Fill shopping cart with variety of products
- [ ] Show different states (empty, loading, populated) where appropriate
- [ ] Verify all sensitive information is using dummy data
- [ ] Check for visual bugs or UI glitches before capturing
- [ ] Apply consistent editing and framing across all screenshots
- [ ] Optimize image files for upload (PNG format recommended)

## Device Frame Options

- **With device frames**: Makes it clear which devices are supported
- **Without device frames**: Maximizes screen real estate for content
- **Custom branded frames**: Can include brand elements and captions

## Screenshot Annotation Tips

If adding text overlays or annotations to screenshots:

- Keep text concise and benefit-focused
- Use consistent font and style that matches app branding
- Ensure annotations don't obscure important UI elements
- Consider using arrows or highlights to draw attention to specific features
- Make sure text is legible on both light and dark backgrounds

## Important Notes

- All screenshots must be of the actual app, not marketing materials
- Screenshots must accurately represent the app experience
- No additional hardware or hands should be visible in screenshots
- Screenshots should not contain App Store badges or pricing information
- Avoid showing notification bars with system icons when possible
