# App Store Metadata Localization Guide

## Primary Languages (Required)

The following languages should be prioritized for launch:

1. **English (US)** - Primary language
2. **Spanish (Mexico)**
3. **French (Canada)**

## Key Metadata to Localize

For each language, ensure the following elements are properly localized:

### Required Elements

- [ ] App name
- [ ] Subtitle
- [ ] Description
- [ ] Keywords
- [ ] Screenshot captions
- [ ] Promotional text

### Optional Elements

- [ ] Release notes
- [ ] Privacy policy link (if language-specific versions exist)
- [ ] Support URL (if language-specific versions exist)
- [ ] Marketing URL (if language-specific versions exist)

## Language-Specific Considerations

### English (US)

- Use American English spelling and conventions
- Focus on farm-fresh, local, and convenience messaging
- Emphasize supporting local dairy farmers

### Spanish (Mexico)

- Highlight family-oriented aspects of dairy products
- Emphasize freshness and quality
- Adjust delivery timing messaging to match local expectations
- Consider cultural significance of dairy products in Mexican cuisine

### French (Canada)

- Highlight artisanal and specialty dairy products
- Emphasize local farm connections
- Consider bilingual requirements for Quebec
- Pay special attention to regulatory language requirements

## Translation Process

1. Start with professionally translated content for base metadata
2. Have native speakers review translations for cultural nuances
3. Consider regional differences within language groups
4. Test translations with target audience representatives
5. Maintain a glossary of key terms for consistency

## Character Count Limitations

Be aware of character limits, which may affect translations:

- App name: 30 characters
- Subtitle: 30 characters
- Keywords: 100 characters
- Description: 4000 characters
- Promotional text: 170 characters

Translations often expand text length (especially from English), so keep original content concise.

## Culturally Specific Adjustments

### Product Names

- Translate generic product names (milk, cheese, yogurt)
- Keep specialty product names in original language with parenthetical explanation
- Example: "Queso Fresco (Fresh Farmer's Cheese)"

### Imagery Selection

- Screenshots should show UI in the target language
- Consider cultural preferences for product arrangements
- Ensure units of measurement are appropriate for the region (oz/ml, etc.)
- Date formats should match regional expectations

### Seasonality

- Highlight seasonal products relevant to each region
- Adjust promotional messaging to match seasonal patterns
- Consider holiday-specific products when applicable

## Quality Assurance

For each localized version:

- [ ] Verify all translated text fits within UI elements in screenshots
- [ ] Check for grammar and spelling errors
- [ ] Ensure consistency across all metadata elements
- [ ] Verify culturally appropriate terminology
- [ ] Confirm that dates, times, and currency formats match regional expectations
- [ ] Test search functionality using localized keywords

## Post-Launch Monitoring

- Track search performance by language
- Analyze conversion rates per language/region
- Collect feedback on translation quality
- Regularly update localized keywords based on performance
